# ussie

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ussie is to let you work with European football data. (the REAL goal
is that I am learning about package development, this is a test/toy package)

## Installation

You can install the development version of ussie from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kpisane/ussie")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ussie)
spain <- uss_make_matches(engsoccerdata::spain, "Spain")
head(spain)
```
