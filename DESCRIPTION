Description: This is a package that lets you play with European football data.  
    It is for a workshop and more or less an identical copy of the Building Tidy
    Tools workshop demo package from rstudio::conf2022.  This copy is incredibly 
    boring and there is no reason you would use it.  If you want to follow the 
    workshop, do that and ignore my personal repo.
