  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(ussie)
library(dplyr)
```
 
The goal of ussie is to help you work with European football data.  Uses engsoccerdata data.  
 
```{r matches_italy}
matches_italy <- uss_make_matches(engsoccerdata::italy, "Italy")
glimpse(matches_italy)
```
 
```{r r_get_matches}
italy <- uss_get_matches('italy')
glimpse(italy)
```

We can add filtering conditions:
```{r uss_get_matches_filter}
uss_get_matches('england', season == 1966) |> 
    glimpse()
```



Important and sad note: Netherlands data is stored as country = 'holland'.  This
is not nice, but this is a toy package and I will see if I can fix that later.
