The goal of ussie is to help you work with European football data.  Uses engsoccerdata data.  
 
```{r matches_italy}
matches_italy <- uss_make_matches(engsoccerdata::italy, "Italy")
glimpse(matches_italy)
```
 
Important and sad note: Netherlands data is stored as country = 'holland'.  This
is not nice, but this is a toy package and I will see if I can fix that later.
